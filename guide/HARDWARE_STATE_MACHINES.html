      <br>
When I was first starting with this stuff I got SO frustrated because I
had NOBODY I could talk to who understood any of it.<br>
I was SURE that computers were not needed, everything could be done
with state machines. Today I have seen it come full circle as I have
created computers with state machines. I have come to understand the
advantages and limits.<br>
I will try to tell the story of my work in order.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">BASIC
CONFIGURATION</span><br>
      <br>
This is the basic configuration:<br>
In this diagram, the lines in and out of the memory and latch represent
an arbitrary number of signals.<br>
I'm not going to specify how many untill we get to specific examples.<br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" alt="" src="p1300137.jpg"><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: center;">1.1 - basic design<br>
      </div>
      <br>
This works by having each memory location specify the address of the
next memory location.<br>
A data latch controls the flow so that only one controlled step is 'fed
back' at a time. A clock source<br>
&nbsp;(tho it does not need to be a regular rate) triggers the next
step.<br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" alt="" src="p1300139.jpg"><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: center;">1.2 - basic operation<br>
      </div>
      <br>
Programming of this system can be done in a table. Here is an example
that performs<br>
an irregular numbering sequence. The values in the sequence must be
unique, because it is not possible<br>
to define more than one next state for a source state.<br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" alt="" src="p1300142.jpg"><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: center;">1.3 - programming table for the
basic machine.<br>
      </div>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">ADDING
OUTPUTS</span><br>
      <br>
As shown though, the system does not really have any inputs or outputs.
It just goes thru a sequence of unique numbers.<br>
So lets make it a bit more complex. Here I have used some of the
outputs of the memory to define a system output value.<br>
Now the state and output can be different. Importantly, the output
value does not need to be unique.<br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" alt="" src="p1300140.jpg"><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: center;">2.1 - machine with outputs added.<br>
      </div>
      <br>
To program this system with outputs we can simply add a new column to
the table.<br>
Here is the revised table with an output column. Note that the output
can have duplicate values.<br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" alt="" src="p1300143.jpg"><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: center;">2.2 - programming table with an
output column added.<br>
      </div>
      <br>
      <br>
The table can also be expressed in a type of program lines, each
consists of an OUTPUT and GOTO command.<br>
Here are the first two lines of the previous table expressed in this
way.<br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" alt="" src="p1300144.jpg"><br>

      </div>
      <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">ADDING
INPUTS</span><br>
      <br>
ok, Now its all gonna blow up, I apologize in advance. <br>
Inputs are added to the addresses of the memory. Now, the next state is
not only dictated by the <br>
feedback from the memory, but also the condition of the input(s) at the
time of the step signal.<br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" alt="" src="p1300145.jpg"><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: center;">3.1 - System with inputs,
feedback, and outputs.<br>
      </div>
      <br>
      <br>
Now the table form of this starts to get kinda complex. To keep it
simpler, I have only given the input<br>
an 'on' and 'off' value (one input bit) , but it could be almost as
many bits as you want. Each source state needs to be<br>
expanded for each possible input state (see, I told you it would
explode) <br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" alt="" src="p1300146.jpg"><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: center;">3.2 - Table memory format with
an input bit.<br>
      </div>
      <br>
In its programming form, the workings of it start to be a bit more
transparent, and its much easier to <br>
build and modify. What is important when doing the design is to make
sure we have accounted for <br>
every combination and state of the feedback and inputs.<br>
      <br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">OH
THE
COPLEXITIES</span><br>
      <br>
In about 2006 I wrote a program that would allow somone to build a
'microcontroller' from a ROM<br>
using this sort of BASIC like programming language. But there was a
problem when it came to actually using it.<br>
My applications had more than one input and output, and I could only
express it as one value.<br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 552px; height: 391px;" alt="" src="romctrl.png"><img style="width: 552px; height: 391px;" alt="" src="romctrl2.png"><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: center;">4.1 - screen shots of 'romctrl'
a tool for building FSM controllers
from memory chips.<br>
      </div>
      <br>
      <br>
To get around this limitation, in about 2007 I wrote another program,
this one allowed you to break your input, feedback, and <br>
output values up, and specify how many values each one had. This would
allow you to specify equations for the outputs and <br>
feedback entries in the table. But it had a problem too, I was quickly
sliding into developing a whole language to make the rules.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 552px; height: 365px;" alt="" src="combo.png"><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: center;">4.2 - screenshot of 'combo'<br>
      </div>
      <br>
The next development was AWESOME. I discovered <a href="https://github.com/Manawyrm/PHPPLD">this</a> project, PHPPLD, it
used PHP to build that table image.<br>
This meant that you could use ANY FUNCTION available in PHP to build
the ROM table for your FSM.<br>
(or LUT or whatever your making with this)<br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 871px; height: 696px;" alt="" src="PHPPLD.png"><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: center;">4.3 PHPPLD project screenshot.<br>
      </div>
      <br>
Of course, being who I am, I wasn't happy with this, and after thinking
about what I really needed<br>
decided to write a library in C. I needed 3 things. Sweep the entire
memory address range, break the <br>
address down into fields, and recompose results into an output value.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 719px; height: 403px;" alt="" src="CPLD.png"><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: center;">4.4 - C_PLD project screenshot.<br>
      </div>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">FIELDS</span><br>
      <br>
I would like to elaborate on bit fields. I will use this example of
hardware.<br>
In the construction of these systems, there is one memory block (LUT)
and regardless of how you use<br>
it, the inputs are expressed as one value and the output is expressed
as one value. To simplify programming<br>
we want these values broken down into fields.<br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" alt="" src="p1300173.jpg"><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: center;">5.1 - example system.<br>
      </div>
      <br>
The memory has an 8 bit value input, A0-A7, and an 8 bit value output,
D0-D7.<br>
Thats all the memory cares about. Which index do you want, here is the
value.<br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" alt="" src="foclut.jpg"><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: center;">5.2 - The memory of the system.<br>
      </div>
      <br>
This state machine has all the elements. It has inputs(orange),
feedback(green), and outputs(blue). Each <br>
of which are 4 bit systems. However even this simple system would
require building a memory table<br>
with 256 values. It is not fun to do this by hand. We will use software
to do this for us.<br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" alt="" src="focsystems.jpg"><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: center;">5.3 - The system elements.
Input, feedback, output.<br>
      </div>
      <br>
The system mechanically breaks down into the following bit fields:<br>
Inputs: A4-7<br>
Outputs: D4-7<br>
Feedback: D0-3 -&gt; A0-3<br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" alt="" src="p1300174.jpg"><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: center;">5.4 - mechanical bit field
breakdowns.<br>
      </div>
      <br>
Furthermore, I will be breaking the 4 bits of feedback into two logical
2 bit values. <br>
- program number.<br>
- program state.<br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" alt="" src="p1300175.jpg"><br>

      <div style="text-align: center;">5.5 - logical bitfield
breakdowns.<br>
      </div>
      <br>
      <br>
I will leave the inputs fairly simple and use each button to select one
of the 4 programs on the system.<br>
The leds I will consider a 4 bit value.<br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" alt="" src="p1300177.jpg"><br>

      </div>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">PROGRAMMING</span><br>
      <br>
This is where the hole seems to exist on most of the information for
these systems.<br>
I'm going to use C_PLD for creating the ROM images that will operate
the state machine. <br>
Unlike the programs I wrote, with C_PLD you write a program, not a
configuration file.<br>
The first step is to configure the environment in main.c.<br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 263px; height: 188px;" alt="" src="C_PLD1.png"><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: center;">6.1 memory configuration in
main.c<br>
      </div>
      <br>
      <br>
Here is the part we will tackle next, I will start by breaking down the
parts of the code and describing how it works.<br>
Then I'll work on getting into modifying it to do particular things.<br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 957px; height: 648px;" alt="" src="C_PLD2.png"><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: center;">6.2 - example source for the
example circuit<br>
      </div>
      <br>
The code has 3 main tasks, break down every address in the table into
the variables used. (orange)<br>
Apply your custom code to modify your variables. (blue)<br>
Recombine the variables into entries for the table. (green)<br>
These values are saved as binary values in a file named output.bin<br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 957px; height: 648px;" alt="" src="C_PLD3.png"><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: center;">6.3 - The different code
components hilighted.<br>
      </div>
      <br>
      <br>
System inputs: As said, we have 3 inputs to form the address of the
table. The keyboard, the program number, and the program state. <br>
These 3 lines of code take an "arbitrary" simulated address input, and
form our 3 variables. These 3 lines of code split the that up for us.<br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 473px; height: 270px;" alt="" src="C_PLD4.png"><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: center;">6.4 - breaking down the address
of the table into variables.<br>
      </div>
      <br>
      <br>
Next is the completely custom code to perform our process. This is the
first example of some code<br>
I will demonstrate on a build of the example hardware. It stays in
program 0, steps thru all 4 states, <br>
Each state turns on one of the output LEDs. <br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 371px; height: 261px;" alt="" src="C_PLD5.png"><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: center;">6.5 - Code to produce our output
values.<br>
      </div>
      <br>
      <br>
The last step is to have it take the output values and compose them
into a single value for the table.<br>
This code is much like the breaking down of the addresses, but in
reverse. This specifies which bits of the <br>
table value our variables are mapped into.<br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 543px; height: 208px;" alt="" src="C_PLD6.png"><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: center;">6.6 - Merging the output
variables into a single value.<br>
      </div>
      <br>
Its important to note that bit splicing positions do not have to be
consecutive or in order. The EPROM pinout<br>
is a good example. On this ROM, the adjacent address lines go from 0-7,
but then 12, and 15. <br>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px; color: rgb(102, 0, 204);">spliceValueFromField(
&amp;my10bitVarI, A, 10,&nbsp; 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,12,15);<br>
      </div>
A 4 bit value could be created with adjacent bits on the other side if
one wanted.<br>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px; color: rgb(102, 51, 255);"><span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204);">spliceValueFromField(
&amp;my4bitVarI, A, 4,&nbsp; 13,8,9,11);</span><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 427px; height: 377px;" alt="" src="ROM1.png"><br>

      <div style="text-align: center;">6.7 - Example of unorderly bits
that can be handled in the bit splicing.<br>

      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">WORKING
EXAMPLES</span><br>
      <br>
The first example is the code we just looked at. <br>
The example uses no inputs, and
only 2 bits of feedback. Program number of feedback is set to zero.<br>
Feedback state is incremented every cycle.<br>
One output LED is turned on for each state, representing the state
numbers 1-4.<br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"> <img style="width: 957px; height: 648px;" alt="" src="EX1.png"><br>

      </div>
<br>In the next example, the 4 buttons determine the 'stable' state of
the
LEDs, which will sequence to a location based on the last button that
was pushed. This is done by having each button latch in a different
program number. Each program sequences to a different state and then
holds there. Like the last example, each state lights an LED. The
outputs have been synchronized between the programs so that the
switching between programs is seamess to the display. The system
maintains the state number when the program number is changed.<br>
